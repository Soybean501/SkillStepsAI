The image shows a silhouette of a person in business attire carrying a briefcase, climbing up a staircase made of books. The books are arranged in an ascending pattern with a graduation cap at the top, symbolizing education and professional advancement through learning. The color scheme is primarily dark blue and teal, with some decorative elements like stars and circles in the background.

Here's a comprehensive plan for building SkillStepsAI that you can hand off to an AI agent:

# SkillStepsAI Development Plan

## 1. Architecture & Technical Setup

- Create a React.js frontend with Next.js for server-side rendering

- Set up email verification and password reset functionality
- Configure social login options (Google, GitHub, etc.)

## 3. Core Learning Path Generation

- Develop prompt engineering system to optimize AI responses
- Create middleware to route requests to appropriate AI models based on complexity
- Implement response parsing to extract structured learning steps
- Build caching system to reduce API costs for similar requests
- Design fallback mechanisms for API failures

## 4. User Interface & Experience

- Design responsive, modern UI with blue theme matching logo
- Implement text input field with autocomplete suggestions
- Create animated learning path visualization
- Design card-based interface for each learning step
- Implement smooth transitions and micro-interactions
- Add progress tracking visualization
- Ensure mobile-friendly design

## 5. Learning Path Management

- Create save/edit/delete functionality for learning paths
- Implement tagging and categorization system
- Build search and filter capabilities
- Design version history tracking
- Add export options (PDF, markdown)
- Implement sharing functionality with privacy controls

## 6. Social & Community Features

- Create public profile pages for users
- Build discovery feed for popular/trending learning paths
- Implement like/bookmark system
- Design commenting functionality
- Add follow user capability
- Create notification system for interactions

## 7. Analytics & Feedback Loop

- Implement user behavior tracking
- Design feedback collection after learning path generation
- Create dashboard for usage metrics
- Build A/B testing framework for UI and AI prompt improvements
- Set up error logging and monitoring

## 8. Admin & Moderation

- Create admin dashboard
- Implement content moderation tools
- Design user management interface
